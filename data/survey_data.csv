The count is essentially from one side of the river. We got the jetboat further up river then we ever have in the past. Slightly more water made this possible. We made it up until the stream got narrow and fast flowing with large boulders. A flight later confirmed there are not many fish above this point.

101-45-10780,Carroll Creek,8/14/15,SURVEY QUALITY: GOOD River was loaded with carcasses throughout the tide flat and early part of survey. These fish were likely washed down with recent rains and high water. At the upper end of our survey there were many fresh chums actively working redds and carcasses were becoming fewer and fewer. I suspect the next visit will also be very productive. Cell C06 on tray 20155084 was found empty at the end of the season. Assume roc C in this tray is unsure pairing. Beads align in other cells.

We then hiked along the logging road until we got to the creek.  We sampled the top portion of the creek first.  Very few chums were seen.  The right fork of the creek serves as the end point in the survey.  It had more chum than the left fork, but also had a ton of log jams, which made travel slow and difficult.  We eventually turned around when the log jams became so thick because we were running out of time.  The left fork was much easier to hike, but only a few chum were seen at the beginning of the fork.  We turned around from the left fork at N56 49.813, W134 06.053.  We then hiked back down to the bridge.  108 chum were seen above the bridge and only 7 below.  Some chum were seen in the intertidal zone on the way out.  Saginaw is characterized by log jams throughout the creek and lots of overhanging alders for chums to hide under.

Sampled until the houses on the point, skipped straight-away section, started sampling from pond to the bridge. Then sampled from just above the road to the island and both channels on either side (sample locations are on the GPS). Fishing hole below strainer was a sample site. Final sampling effort was at valhalla. Hiked on the trail past valhalla approx. 1/4 mi. Didn't see any live or dead chum at our end survey location, only pinks.

Only a handful of samples came from live fish. Pinks were almost all pre-spawn and they were in copious amounts. Worked steadily upstream until it became too overgrown and braided for us to continue. Also, it was a bear safety concern. The weather was overcast and intermittantly raining through the day. The water had good visibility with a normal flow.

With gafts in hand, and fishing hooks ready to pounce at the next salmon upstream, they surveyed and sampled the creek they call 'Ushk' with likes that had never been seen. As the blazing sun began to set on southeastern Alaskan bay, there was a hint of relief that swirled in the small boats cabin where the young technicians recovered. Blood had been spilled that day, Not their own of course, but just the sight of the viscous liquid entailed a hard fought battle.

Some pools from last visit are now completely filled in with gravel.  Many carcasses were hanging high on roots and log jams or burried in new gravel bars.  Burried carcasses and those that flooded out of the banks of the creek during the last flood likely skewed the dead count because they were not observed.  All of the live chum observed were quite moldy.  Many of today's samples came from highly decomposed carcasses, suggesting they did not wash out in the flood.

115-20-10520,Sawmill Creek,8/16/19,"SURVEY QUALITY: EXCELLENT. IMPORTANT NOTE: a small mix-up of otoliths occured during QA process and was noticed during 48 hour QA, therefore the survey was edited and retransmitted after another QA. As you will see in comments for individual samples, cell 16 has two missing otoliths and cell 18 has 4 otoliths in it. We believe that two of the otoliths in cell 18 belong to cell 16, but we cannot be sure, therefore these two samples have been labeled as 'uncertain pairing'. Since 17 is between the two, this has also been labeled as 'uncertain pairing'. We feel fairly confident that the other 27 samples in this tray are OK. Survey began at low tide today.
